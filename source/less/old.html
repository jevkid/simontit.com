                <div id = "opt6" style="display:none"><br>Following my graduation from Cardiff University, I began working at a company in Cardiff called Eysys, developing travel sites for companies both in the UK and Canada. Our team at Eysys was so successful that we recently merged with another local company, Comtec, and a Canadian company, Incentriq, to build better travel solutions for our clients. Here I've been given the opportunity to work on both design and development, and have furthered my skills in JavaScript and jQuery, as well as picked up a new HTML templating language, Jade (Pug). Working at Eysys has taught me the importance of the software development process, and how that works within a team.

Working remotely from Cardiff, I have been redesigning and developing their new website. I have been trusted with completing this project mostly independently, and it has been a wonderful experience that I know will aid me following graduation.

                <div id = "opt2" style="display:none"><br>I recently finished a three-month internship as a Software Engineer intern for Skyscanner, based in their Barcelona office. I worked on projects displaying and manipulating data as well as creating APIs and integrating them into the frontend. A large part of my internship was spent designing and implementing dashboards to display data pertaining to Skyscanner's hotel partners. I learned a variety of front and backend technologies as well as software development tools while working with a great team, and can't wait to exercise these skills again soon.<br>

I was successful, and began my term over the summer of 2014. Along with five other committee members with different roles, we’re able to interact and network with students from all years, organize and lead society events, and share Computer Science related opportunities to our members. This has been one of the most enjoyable positions I’ve held so far, allowing for me to further develop both my leadership and team working skills. I was fortunate enough to be re-elected for the 2015/2016 school year and look forward to continuing this role!<br>

Earlier this year I was elected by the student body as International Students’ Officer, making me part of the university’s Student Senate as well. I’m one of eight elected campaign officers in the Students’ Union, all representing different factions of the university. My position involves creating a more enjoyable university experience for students from other countries, who make up 20% of the university's population. This entails gathering feedback, putting on events, relaying concerns to the university, and campaigning for related current issues. Being a campaign officer, I also have a seat on the Student Senate, where I can discuss and vote on motions brought forward by others, as well as bring my own to the table. It’s been incredibly educational to be a part of the student government and to be able to make a difference in the union as well as the school.<br>

This allowed me to be a voice for the students on my course, and to meet with other representatives and staff within the school. I’ve been chosen to continue this role in my second year, and have been promoted to “Super Representative”, meaning I meet with the head of the university as well as the head of the school of Computer Science. This gives me an even greater opportunity to gain perspective from students, and to relay their concerns or complaints to the appropriate parties.<br>

                <h3>ONTarget</h3>
                <p>For my 2nd year group project, we were required to create a web-based service using image or audio analysis. My team and I chose image analysis, and we created a social media website for archery clubs across the UK. Users were able to upload photos of their targets, and our service would automatically analyse the score based on where the arrow was, and additional details the user had entered. Teams could also keep track of different players' scores using a leaderboard system. The code can be found on my <a href = "https://github.com/jevkid/OnTarget" target = "blank">GitHub</a>, and screenshots are under Web Design below.</p>
                <h3>IBM Smarter Planet Project</h3>
                <p>For my final year project, my team and I were given the opportunity to work with the Emerging Technologies group at IBM. This began in September 2015 and was completed by May 2016. IBM gave us one goal: to develop and implement a system that promoted a "smarter planet" and involved data analytics. Using this, we came up with the idea to develop a sensor-based system that could collect and analyse data from student accommodation in order to provide real-time information, alerts, and data analytics pertaining to utility usage and security. Using a Raspberry Pi, several affordable sensors, and <a href="https://sen.se/mother/" target = "blank">Sen.se's Mother</a>, we were able to accomplish these goals. To read more about the project, you can check out my dissertation <a href="images/MeganJevin_Report_WEB.pdf" target = "blank">here</a>. If you'd like to see the code that was developed, it can be viewed on my <a href="https://github.com/jevkid/SmarterShare" target = "blank">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

                    I’m Megan Jevin, a recent graduate from Cardiff University with a degree in Software Engineering, and current Front End Developer at Eysys. During my time at university, I took part in numerous activities in addition to my studies. I was a Student Academic Representative for my course each year, and was elected twice as the president of the Computer Science and Informatics Society. The summer following my second year, I completed a three-month internship as a Software Engineer for Skyscanner in Barcelona.
                    <br><br><i class="fa fa-coffee fa-3x"></i><br><br>
                    I'm originally from Nashville, Tennessee, but I moved to Wales to continue my studies and see the world. Since moving to Cardiff in 2013, I've gotten the chance to see 12 different countries and 20 different cities! I love sharing my travels through the lens of my camera, and I run a popular travel blog documenting them as well. I've always been invested in the arts, and in addition to photography I enjoy drawing and graphic design. I love practicing these in my free time, as well as trying out new recipes, drinking coffee, and reading a good book.

                    One of the most important details I could say about myself is that I'm an innovative and inspirational person. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to help others realise their full potential, and to encourage their success. I’m a self-starter and a natural leader. My creativity has allowed me to excel in what I love, often giving me an advantage when working on challenging tasks. I'm not a perfectionist, but when I begin a project I work until it meets and exceeds expectations. I’m exceptionally intuitive and a quick learner, always ready to begin a new challenge.

                    My career aspirations include working in web development or sensor-based systems involving the IoT, but I’m also very invested in design, whether it be web or software. Due to my interest in travel, I hope I'm able to find a career that allows me to do what I love while seeing the world. I'm always looking for contacts in my field of study, so please do feel free to contact me!
